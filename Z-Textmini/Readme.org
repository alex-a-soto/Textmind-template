You should delete this directory from your Textmind.  

It's just an example of a Textmini, which you can use in your own satellite repos.  You should NOT use it in your main Textmind repo.

It's my personal Textmini.  It controls the evolution of this Textmind template repo.

I actually do my work here.  If the directory is empty, that means I'm caught up, at least with this part of my info pipeline.

Normally I prefix Textmini with =1-Textmini=, but that spot was already taken here.

Arguably I should hide this directory in a developer git branch.  But I think it's useful for you to see what a Textmini directory in a Textmind satellite repo should look like.
