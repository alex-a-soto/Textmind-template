This is my personal Textmini.  It controls the evolution of this Textmind template repo.

I actually do my work here.  If the directory is empty, that means I'm caught up, at least with this part of my info pipeline.

You should delete this directory from your Textmind.  It's just an example of a Textmini, which you can use in your own satellite repos.

Normally I prefix Textmini with =1-Textmini=, but that spot was already taken here.
