* Hyperlinked prose

=2-Linked= is a directory for your linked prose.  It is within Org's secondary search scope.  (This means opening org-id links will work.)  

Directories are searched recursively, so use as much tree depth as you need.

Org link search finds GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifiers) in =1-Agenda= and =2-Linked=.  Org agenda search only finds headings in =1-Agenda=.

Org-id searches can rely on cached results, whereas Org agenda searches normally do not.  Therefore =2-Linke= can store much more text than =1-Agenda=, without causing excessive Emacs lag.
